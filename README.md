# Expoloratory-Data-Analysis-Trial-2
In this repository, I'm going to walk through (with you on) the basics of <b>Exploratory Data Analysis.</b> We will however be using Python (not R).<br>
Together we will expolre all the possible complexities of Data. We will explore a Dataset and try to make as much sense as possible from it.<br>
We will do the following:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Data Preparation</li>
  <li>Summaries and Distribution</li>
  <li>Visualizaion</li>
</ol>

# <a href = "">Data Preparation</a>
The essence of Data Preparation is getting our raw data sets ready for exploration and visualization.<br>
We first begin by selecting only the columns we will need. This helps to reduce the load of useless(contexually) data we have.<br>

# <a href = "">Visualizaion<a/>
